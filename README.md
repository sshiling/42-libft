# libft
Implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions

Libft is the first project in studying programm at School 42 (UNIT Factory).
The purpeous of project is to introduce to students standart C functions that we will be able to use in our future projects.
To give deeper understanding of functions we needed to create our own realisation of standart functions.

All standart functions is created in accordans to Norm - the bunch of rules according to which code should be performed.

The project consists of 3 main logicval parts:
* Standart Libc functions
* Additional functions
* Bonus part functions

In bonus part there are functiones proposed in task and some personal functions that I decided to create.

How to compile library:

Using Makefile you can create library file libft.a
Makefile has 4 main options:
make - to comile C files - create object files and library libft.a
make clean - to remove object files
make fclean - remove libft.a file
make re - recompile library

Short description of each function:
