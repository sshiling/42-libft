# libft
### Implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions

Libft is the first project in the study program at School 42 (UNIT Factory).
The purpose of the project is to introduce to students standard C functions that we will be able to use in our future projects.
To give a deeper understanding of functions we needed to create our own realization of standard functions.

All functions are created in accordance with Norm - the bunch of rules how code should be formatted.

#### The project consists of 3 main logical parts:
* Standart Libc functions
* Additional functions
* Bonus part functions

In bonus part, there are functions proposed in the task and some personal functions that I decided to create.

#### How to compile library:

Using Makefile you can create library file libft.a<br/>
Makefile has 4 main options:<br/>
* **make** - to compile C files - create object files and library libft.a<br/>
* **make clean** - to remove object files<br/>
* **make fclean** - remove libft.a file<br/>
* **make re** - recompile the library<br/>

#### Short description of each function:
